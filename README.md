# ResNet_ImageClassification
Classifying weather images using a custom-built ResNet50
- Applied custom-built ResNet50 using Tensorflow and Keras to classify a weather image dataset into 4 different types with >90% accuracy.
- Compared the performance of different deep neural networks among 4 different ResNet(18, 34, 50, 101) and 4 plain deep NN.
